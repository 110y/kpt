### Synopsis

kpt was developed to solve the problem of **fetching and updating configuration packages**.
Rather than solving all problems related to configuration, kpt was designed to be
composed with other solutions developed within the Kubernetes ecosystem such as the
Kubernetes project based tooling.

kpt focusses on a "configuration as data", rather than a "configuration as code".
In this model configuration is packaged as data objects, rather than as imperative
code containing branches and loops.  Configuration as data allows solutions to be
written in different languages and composed together in ways that follow the
unix philosophy.

The following tutorial covers how to compose kpt with other tools in the ecosystem
to build delivery solutions.

### Configuration Overview

The configuration tooling space can be broken down into a number of categories:

1. **Packaging**

   - Fetch -- get a bundle of Resource configuration
   - Update -- pull in upstream changes to Resource configuration
   - Publish -- publish a bundle of Resource configuration

2. **Development**

   - Abstraction -- substitution, generation, injection, etc
   - Customization -- configuring blueprints, defining variants, etc
   - Validation -- policy enforcement, linting, etc

3. **Actuation**

   - Apply -- apply configuration to a cluster
   - Status -- waiting for changes to be fully rolled out
   - Prune -- deletion of Resources no longer appearing in the config

4. **Visibility** /  **Inspection**

   - Search for Resources within a Package matching a constraint
   - Visualize the relationship between Resources
   
5. **Discovery**

   - Discover new publicly published packages

#### Tools

| Discovery     | *unsolved*             |                                                   |

### Packaging: ` + "`" + `kpt get` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `kpt update` + "`" + `

  Packaging enables fully or partially specified Resource configuration
  + related artifacts to be published and consumed, as well as facilitates
  updating configuration from upstream.

  Example Use Cases:

  - Fetch a *Blueprint* or *Example* and fork or extend it
  - Fetch a *Configuration Function* Resources
  - Fetch a set of configuration to be applied directly to a cluster

  - Update a forked *Blueprint* from upstream
  - Update a *Configuration Function* Resource from upstream
  - Update configuration applied to a cluster

  Example:

  Fetch a Blueprint:

    kpt get https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/cassandra cassandra/
    
  Update a Blueprint to a specific git commit, merging Resources:
  
    kpt update cassandra@322d78b --strategy resource-merge 

### Development: ` + "`" + `kustomize build` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `kustomize config run` + "`" + `

  Development of configuration is about developing the configuration which will
  be applied to an apiserver.

  It may involve a number of activities:
  
  1. Developing Abstractions
     
     - Templating Resources -- Jinja, YTT, Helm
     - Generating Resources From DSLs --Cue,  Ksonnet, Jsonnet, Terraform
     - Generating Resources Programmatically -- Starlark, TypeScript
  
  2. Developing Blueprint Customizations
  
     - Change replica counts
     - Change container image
     - Add environment variables
  
  3. Developing Variant Customizations
  
     - Dev, Test, Staging, Production
     - us-west, us-east, us-central, asia, europe
  
  4. Injecting Cross-Cutting elements into Resources
  
     - T-Shirt sizing containers based on annotations
     - Injecting side car containers
     - Injecting init containers
  
  5. Validating Resources
  
     - Ensuring resource reservations are specified
     - Ensuring container images are tagged

  The kpt architecture facilitates decoupling programs and tools from
  the configuration itself by transforming configuration using configuration
  functions.  That is the packages themselves contain Resource configuration
  rather than code (e.g. templates, DSLs, etc).  The packaged Resources may
  be modified or expanded by external programs, such as kustomize.
  
  ` + "`" + `kustomize` + "`" + ` is a tool which can be used to develop configuration by:
   
   - defining customization variants
   - applying functions which may be used for developing abstractions, cross-cutting
     modifications, and validation

  Example Use Cases:
  
  - Develop variants for test, staging, production versions of config
  - Develop a high-level "App" abstraction API which takes only a few inputs
    and generates a Deployment, Service and ConfigMap
  - Develop an annotation for t-shirt sizing resource reservations, setting cpu
    and memory to values for small, medium, and large
  - Develop validation to ensure container images are always tagged
  
  Examples:
  
  See the [example functions](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/tree/master/functions/examples)
    
    kustomize config run DIR

  See the [kustomize examples](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/tree/master/examples)
  
    kustomize build DIR  

### Actuation: ` + "`" + `kubectl apply` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `kustomize status` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `kustomize prune` + "`" + `

  Applying a collection of configuration may involve several steps, and may require
  orchestrating the actuation of several different packages.  The building blocks of
  actuating configuration are:
  
  1. Apply
  
     - Take collection of local Resources and send to the cluster
     - Merge locally defined desired state with cluster defined desired state
       (e.g. keep replica count defined by autoscaler in the cluster)
  
  2. Status
  
     - Track the status of the changes until they have been fully rolled out
     - Block until the process completes, or fails to make progress for some period of time 
       (e.g. timesout)
  
  3. Prune
  
     - Identify Resources that exist in the cluster, but have been deleted locally and delete them
     - Support diff / dry-run
     
  The kpt architecture facilitates using the Kubernetes project based tooling,
  such as ` + "`" + `kubectl` + "`" + ` and ` + "`" + `kustomize` + "`" + ` for actuating configuration changes.
  
  Example Use Cases:
  
  1. Apply a package of configuration to a cluster
  2. Wait until it is successful, printing an error on failure
  3. Delete Resources that have deleted from the package since it was last applied
  
  **Note:** the actuation steps may be performed by automation using a GitOps approach --
  e.g. trigger Google Cloud Build to perform the actuation when PRs are merged into
  release branches.

  Examples:
  
    # apply non-local Resources -- skips config-functions
    kustomize config cat DIR | kubectl apply -f -
    
    # block on completion of changes
    kustomize status
    
    # delete Resources removed from the package
    kustomize prune

### Visibility / Inspection: ` + "`" + `kustomize config tree` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `kustomize config grep` + "`" + `

  When working with configuration as data, the configuration may become verbose.
  This makes it challenging to quickly understand the state of the system declared
  locally.
  
  Tools such as ` + "`" + `kustomize config tree` + "`" + ` help parse and visualize packages of configuration.
  They may be used with tools such as ` + "`" + `kustomize config grep` + "`" + ` to query configuration.
  
  Example Use Cases:
  
  - Display all the Resources in a package
  - Display all Resources in a package containing an untagged container image
  - Display all Resources in a package containing a container without resource reservations

  Examples:
  
    # display resources, as well as container names and images
    kustomize config tree DIR/ --name --image
    
    # find Resources named nginx
    kustomize config grep "metadata.name=nginx" my-dir/    

### Putting It All Together

1. Fetch a package of configuration

       kpt get https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/cassandra cassandra/

2. Inspect the package

       kustomize config tree cassandra/

3. Customize or Develop the package

       # add configuration functions, then run
       kustomize config run cassandra/
        
       # or add kustomize variants that use it as a base
       mkdir prod/
       vi prod/Kustomization.yaml

4. Apply the package to a cluster

       kustomize config cat cassandra/ | kubectl apply -f -
       kustomize status cassandra/
       kustomize prune cassandra/
        
   or
   
       kustomize build prod/ | kubectl apply -f -
       kustomize build prod/| kustomize status
       kustomize build prod/ | kustomize prune

var FaqShort = `Frequently Asked Questions`
var FaqLong = `
Q: **How does kpt fit in with other OSS Kubernetes tools?**
A: kpt is intended to be composed with other tools from the Kubernetes ecosystem.
   Rather than attempting to solve all problems related to configuration, kpt
   is focused solving how to publish and consume configuration packages.  kpt
   was developed to complement the OSS Kubernetes project tooling such as
   ` + "`" + `kubectl` + "`" + ` and ` + "`" + `kustomize` + "`" + `.

Q: **How do I use kpt with the Kubernetes project tooling?**
A: kpt may be used to publish, fetch and update configuration packaging.
   The project tooling may be used to manipulate and apply the fetched configuration.

Q: **How can I use kpt to create blueprint packages?**
A: Blueprints may be published as kpt packages, using kpt for fetching and
   updating the packages from upstream.
   The local copy of the blueprint package may be directly edited, or other
   customization techniques may be applied (e.g. ` + "`" + `kustomize build` + "`" + `).

Q: **What are some examples of blueprint customization techniques?**
A: - Using cnfiguration functions (i.e. ` + "`" + `kustomize config run` + "`" + `)
   - Using Kustomizations (i.e. ` + "`" + `kustomize build` + "`" + `)
   - Duck-typed setter commands (i.e. ` + "`" + `kustomize duck CMD` + "`" + `)

Q: **What are configuration functions?**
A: Configuration functions are programs applied to configuration which may generate, transform
   or validate new or existing configuration.  Functions are typically published as container
   images applied to a configuration package.
   See ` + "`" + `kustomize help config run` + "`" + ` for more information.

Q: **What are duck-typed setter commands?**
A: Duck-typed setter commands are similar to the imperative ` + "`" + `kubectl set` + "`" + ` commands,
   but operate against local Resource configuration and use duck-typing to identify
   the supported setters.
   See ` + "`" + `kustomize help duck` + "`" + ` for more information.

Q: **How do I parameterize kpt packages?**
A: Packages may be parameterized by using templating with configuration functions.
   The function encapsulates the parameterized version of theResource, and emits
   the expanded Resource.
   See ` + "`" + `kustomize help config run` + "`" + ` for more information.

Q: **Does kpt work for non-Resource packages such as Terraform or Helm Charts?**
A: Yes, kpt packages can contain non-Resource packaging artifacts.  These
   artifacts do not support Resource specific operations -- e.g.
   The ` + "`" + `update` + "`" + ` command ` + "`" + `resource-merge` + "`" + ` strategy will not work against them,
   but the ` + "`" + `alpha-git-patch` + "`" + ` strategy will.
   
Q: **How can I apply kpt packages to a cluster?**
A: kpt is designed to work with the OSS Kubernetes Kubernetes tools such
   as ` + "`" + `kubectl` + "`" + ` and ` + "`" + `kustomize` + "`" + `.  Both the ` + "`" + `kubectl apply` + "`" + ` and the ` + "`" + `kustomize apply` + "`" + `
   are supported.

var FetchAPackageShort = `How to fetch a package from a remote source`
var FetchAPackageLong = `
### Synopsis

Packages are directories of Configuration published as subdirectories to git repositories.

- No additional package metadata or structure is required for a package to be fetched
- Format is natively compatible with ` + "`" + `kubectl apply` + "`" + ` and ` + "`" + `kustomize` + "`" + `
- May be fetched and updated to specific revisions (using git tags or branches)
- May also include non-configuration files or metadata

### Fetch the Cassandra package

  Fetch a "raw" package (e.g. config only -- no kpt metadata) from the kubernetes examples repo.

	kpt get  https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/cassandra cassandra/

  ` + "`" + `kpt get` + "`" + ` fetched the remote package from HEAD of the
  https://github.com/kubernetes/examples master branch.

	$ kustomize config tree cassandra/
	cassandra
	├── [cassandra-service.yaml]  v1.Service cassandra
	├── [cassandra-statefulset.yaml]  apps/v1.StatefulSet cassandra
	└── [cassandra-statefulset.yaml]  storage.k8s.io/v1.StorageClass fast
	
  ` + "`" + `kustomize config tree` + "`" + ` printed the package structure -- displaying both the Resources as well as the
  files the Resources are specified in.

	$ kpt desc cassandra
	+-----------------+-----------+----------------------------------------+-----------+---------+---------+
	| LOCAL DIRECTORY |   NAME    |           SOURCE REPOSITORY            |  SUBPATH  | VERSION | COMMIT  |
	+-----------------+-----------+----------------------------------------+-----------+---------+---------+
	| cassandra       | cassandra | https://github.com/kubernetes/examples | cassandra | master  | 1543966 |
	+-----------------+-----------+----------------------------------------+-----------+---------+---------+

  ` + "`" + `kpt desc LOCAL_PACKAGE` + "`" + ` prints information about the source of the package -- e.g. 
  the repo, subdirectory, etc.

### Fetch the Guestbook package

	$ kpt get https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/guestbook ./my-guestbook-copy

  The guestbook package contains multiple guest book instances in separate
  subdirectories.

	$ kustomize config tree my-guestbook-copy/
	my-guestbook-copy
	├── [frontend-deployment.yaml]  apps/v1.Deployment frontend
	├── [frontend-service.yaml]  v1.Service frontend
    ...
	├── all-in-one
	│   ├── [frontend.yaml]  apps/v1.Deployment frontend
	│   ├── [frontend.yaml]  v1.Service frontend
	│   ├── [guestbook-all-in-one.yaml]  apps/v1.Deployment frontend
    ...
	└── legacy
		├── [frontend-controller.yaml]  v1.ReplicationController frontend
		├── [redis-master-controller.yaml]  v1.ReplicationController redis-master
		└── [redis-slave-controller.yaml]  v1.ReplicationController redis-slave

  The separate guestbook subpackages contain variants of the same guestbook application.
  To fetch only the all-in-one instance, specify the instance subdirectory as
  part of the package.

	$ kpt get https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/guestbook/all-in-one ./new-guestbook-copy

  ` + "`" + `kpt get` + "`" + ` only fetched the all-in-one subpackage.

	$ kustomize config tree new-guestbook-copy
	new-guestbook-copy
	├── [frontend.yaml]  apps/v1.Deployment frontend
	├── [frontend.yaml]  v1.Service frontend
	├── [guestbook-all-in-one.yaml]  apps/v1.Deployment frontend
	├── [guestbook-all-in-one.yaml]  v1.Service frontend
	├── [guestbook-all-in-one.yaml]  apps/v1.Deployment redis-master
	├── [guestbook-all-in-one.yaml]  v1.Service redis-master
	├── [guestbook-all-in-one.yaml]  apps/v1.Deployment redis-slave
	├── [guestbook-all-in-one.yaml]  v1.Service redis-slave
	├── [redis-slave.yaml]  apps/v1.Deployment redis-slave
	└── [redis-slave.yaml]  v1.Service redis-slave

### Package Versioning

  Since packages are stored in git, git references may be used to fetch a specific version
  of a package.

	kpt get https://github.com/pwittrock/examples/staging/cockroachdb@v1.0.0 cockroachdb/

  Specifying '@version' after the package uri fetched the package at that revision.
  The version may be a git branch, tag or ref.
  
  Note: git references may also be used with ` + "`" + `kpt update` + "`" + ` to rollout new configuration versions.
  See ` + "`" + `kpt help update` + "`" + ` for more information.

### With Helm

  ` + "`" + `kpt get` + "`" + ` may be used to write expanded ` + "`" + `helm` + "`" + ` templates to packages.

	helm fetch stable/redis
	helm template redis-9.* | kpt get - ./redis-9/

  This imported the expanded package Resources from stdin and created a local kpt package.

	$ kustomize config tree redis-9/
	redis-9
	├── [release-name-redis-headless_service.yaml]  v1.Service release-name-redis-headless
	├── [release-name-redis-health_configmap.yaml]  v1.ConfigMap release-name-redis-health
	├── [release-name-redis-master_service.yaml]  v1.Service release-name-redis-master
	├── [release-name-redis-master_statefulset.yaml]  apps/v1beta2.StatefulSet release-name-redis-master
	├── [release-name-redis-slave_service.yaml]  v1.Service release-name-redis-slave
	├── [release-name-redis-slave_statefulset.yaml]  apps/v1beta2.StatefulSet release-name-redis-slave
	├── [release-name-redis_configmap.yaml]  v1.ConfigMap release-name-redis
	└── [release-name-redis_secret.yaml]  v1.Secret release-name-redis

  The names of the Resource files may be configured using the --pattern flag.

	helm fetch stable/redis
	helm template redis-9.* | kpt get - ./redis-9/ --pattern '%n.resource.yaml'
	
  This configured the generated resource file names to be RESOURCENAME.resource.yaml
  instead of RESOURCENAME_RESOURCETYPE.yaml
  Multiple Resources with the same name are put into the same file:

	$ kustomize config tree redis-9/
	redis-9
	├── [release-name-redis-headless.resource.yaml]  v1.Service release-name-redis-headless
	├── [release-name-redis-health.resource.yaml]  v1.ConfigMap release-name-redis-health
	├── [release-name-redis-master.resource.yaml]  v1.Service release-name-redis-master
	├── [release-name-redis-master.resource.yaml]  apps/v1beta2.StatefulSet release-name-redis-master
	├── [release-name-redis-slave.resource.yaml]  v1.Service release-name-redis-slave
	├── [release-name-redis-slave.resource.yaml]  apps/v1beta2.StatefulSet release-name-redis-slave
	├── [release-name-redis.resource.yaml]  v1.ConfigMap release-name-redis
	└── [release-name-redis.resource.yaml]  v1.Secret release-name-redis
	
 Run ` + "`" + `kpt help get` + "`" + ` for more information on --pattern options

### With Kustomize

  ` + "`" + `kpt get` + "`" + ` may also be used to convert ` + "`" + `kustomize` + "`" + ` output into a package

    # fetch a kustomize example
	kpt get https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/examples/wordpress wordpress/
	
	# build the kustomize package and use ` + "`" + `kpt get` + "`" + ` to write the output to a directory
	kustomize build wordpress/ | kpt get - wordpress-expanded/

  This expanded the Kustomization into a new package

	$ kustomize config tree wordpress-expanded/
	wordpress-expanded
	├── [demo-mysql-pass_secret.yaml]  v1.Secret demo-mysql-pass
	├── [demo-mysql_deployment.yaml]  apps/v1beta2.Deployment demo-mysql
	├── [demo-mysql_service.yaml]  v1.Service demo-mysql
	├── [demo-wordpress_deployment.yaml]  apps/v1beta2.Deployment demo-wordpress
	└── [demo-wordpress_service.yaml]  v1.Service demo-wordpress

### With Grep

  ` + "`" + `kpt get` + "`" + ` can also be combine with ` + "`" + `kustomize config grep` + "`" + ` to filter Resources from
  one package and create another.

	$ kustomize config grep "metadata.name=wordpress$" wordpress/ | kpt get - ./new-wordpress

  This will create a new package from the Resource Config emitted by grep

	$ kustomize config tree new-wordpress/
	new-wordpress
	├── [wordpress_deployment.yaml]  apps/v1.Deployment wordpress
	└── [wordpress_service.yaml]  v1.Service wordpress`

var FutureDevelopmentShort = `List of features planned for the future`
var FutureDevelopmentLong = `
### Synopsis

Following is a list of ` + "`" + `kpt` + "`" + ` features planned for future development:

- Check for updates
  - List packages that may be updated
  - List available updates for a package

- Resource merge conflict resolution strategies
  - Fail on conflict
  - Choose local on conflict`

var PublishAPackageShort = `How to publish a package to a remote source`
var PublishAPackageLong = `
### Synopsis

Any bundle of Resource configuration may be published as a package using ` + "`" + `git` + "`" + `.

` + "`" + `kpt init` + "`" + ` initializes a directory with optional package metadata such as a
package documentation file.

### Examples

    kpt init my-package/ --name my-package --description 'fun new package'
    git add my-package && git commit -m 'new kpt package'
    git push origin master`

var UpdateALocalPackageShort = `How to update a package version from a remote source`
var UpdateALocalPackageLong = `
### Synopsis

  Local packages may be updated by rebasing them on top of upstream changes.
  Multiple strategies are supported for merging in updates.
  Run ` + "`" + `kpt help update` + "`" + ` for the list of supported update strategies

  - If no new revision is specified in the update, and the source was a branch, then the package
    will be updated to the tip of that branch.
  - The local package must be committed to git be updated 
  - Updates to packages generated from stdin are not yet supported

## Update an unchanged package

  Prepare the package to be updated

	kpt get https://github.com/pwittrock/examples/staging/cockroachdb@v1.0.0 cockroachdb/
	git add cockroachdb/ && git commit -m 'fetch cockroachdb'

  Diff a local package vs a new upstream version

  NOTE: the diff viewer can be controlled by setting KPT_EXTERNAL_DIFF --
  'export KPT_EXTERNAL_DIFF=my-differ'.
  See ` + "`" + `kpt help diff` + "`" + ` for more options.

	kpt diff cockroachdb/@v1.1.0 --diff-type remote
	diff ...
	76c76
	<   replicas: 3
	---
	>   replicas: 5
	118c118
	<         image: cockroachdb/cockroach:v1.1.0
	---
	>         image: cockroachdb/cockroach:v1.1.1


  Update the package to the new version.  This requires that the package is unmodified from when
  it was fetched.

	kpt update cockroachdb@v1.1.0
	git diff cockroachdb/

  The updates have not been staged by kpt.

## Updating merging remote changes with local changes

  Stage the package to be updated

	kpt get https://github.com/pwittrock/examples/staging/cockroachdb@v1.0.0 cockroachdb/
	git add cockroachdb/ && git commit -m 'fetch cockroachdb'

  Make local edits to the package

	sed -i '' 's/port: 8080/port: 8081/g' ./cockroachdb/cockroachdb-statefulset.yaml
	git add . && git commit -m 'change cockroachdb port from 8080 to 8081'

  Diff the local package vs the original source upstream package -- see what you've changed

	$ kpt diff cockroachdb/
	diff ...
	17c17
	<   - port: 8081
	---
	>   - port: 8080
	50c50
	<   - port: 8081
	---
	>   - port: 8080

  Diff the local package vs a new upstream version -- see what you will be updating to

	$ kpt diff cockroachdb/@v1.4 --diff-type combined
	diff ...
	>     foo: bar
	17c18
	<   - port: 8081
	---
	>   - port: 8080
	50c51
	<   - port: 8081
	---
	>   - port: 8080
	67c68
	<   minAvailable: 67%
	---
	>   minAvailable: 70%
	77c78
	<   replicas: 3
	---
	>   replicas: 7

  Update the package to a new version.

  **NOTE:** --strategy is required when the local package has been changed from its source.
  In this case we have changed the local port field, so we must specify a strategy.

	kpt update cockroachdb@v1.4 --strategy alpha-git-patch
	git diff HEAD^ HEAD

  This merged the upstream changes into the local package, and created a new git commit.

## Update with local merge conflicts

  Stage the package to be updated

	kpt get https://github.com/pwittrock/examples/staging/cockroachdb@v1.0.0 cockroachdb/
	git add cockroachdb/ && git commit -m 'fetch cockroachdb'

  Make local edits to the package.  Edit a field that will be changed upstream.

  View the 3way diff -- requires a diff viewer capable of 3way diffs (e.g. meld)

	kpt diff cockroachdb/@v1.4 --diff-type 3way

  This will show that the replicas field cannot be merged without a conflict -- it has
  been changed both in the upstream new package version, and in the local package.

  Go ahead and update the package to a new version anyway.  Expect a merge conflict.

	kpt update cockroachdb@v1.4 --strategy alpha-git-patch

  View the conflict

	$ git diff
